We have many fleeting ideas, learnings, and random musing every day, but there isn't a tool that helps us record and organize these information efficiently. The current knowledge management tools like notion and obsidian make it hard to just add a small piece of note because of their complex structure. Imagine wanting to jot down a quick thought inspired by a seminar but having to go through all the folders and hyperlinks in your note-taking app to correctly place your note, by the time you find the place your thought may have faded.

Genote aims to solve this problem using RAG and LLM. It allows you to dump all your thoughts at once without worrying about organization and format. We use LLM to process your rough draft and use RAG to find existing notes that are relevant to determine the position of this new draft. Your thoughts get automatically inserted into your knowledge-base in the correct structure, through adding or even editing notes, making a self-organized second brain.
